1 . We are looking to develop an app, similar to the swipe left/swipe (like/unlike) right functionality as Tinder. 

2. However, instead of photos, submitters post 30 sec clips where users can like on not like the submission.

3 . Needs to have the ability of posting comments about the video. 

4. Users need to login with Facebook account or email address.

5. This app will record the likes submitted and can display a top ten list of top videos.

6. This app is geared toward talent videos and will eventually work as a contest with a reward.

7. Submitters should be able to build their profile and link their Twitter, FB, website and bio

Premise: Tinder like app with swipe left/right feature that displays 30 sec videos of people posting their talent (singing, dancing, etc)
